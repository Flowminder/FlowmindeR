  fig.path = "man/figures/README-",

## FlowmindeR 

This repo contains the functions of the `FlowmindeR` package, the package provides:

- A ggplot style for producing Flowminder graphics for producing graphs in `ggplot`
- R Markdown templates to produce branded PDF and HTML documents
- Convenient links to use Flowminder themed from Mapbox

## Installing FlowmindeR

`FlowmindeR` is not on CRAN, so you will have to install it directly from Github using `remotes`. If you do not have the `remotes` package installed, you will have to run the first line in the code below as well. 

```{r, eval = F}
# install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('Flowminder/FlowmindeR')
```

## Using the functions

Detailed examples on how to use the functions included within the `FlowmindeR` package to produce graphics are included in the [full vignettes](vignette/graphics.html), as well as a more general reference manual for working with `ggplot2`.

### Plotting

`set_fm_style()`: has no arguments and used to set the default ggplot themes. What it does is generally makes text size, font and colour, axis lines, axis text and many other standard chart components into the Flowminder style. 

The function is pretty basic and does not change or adapt based on the type of chart you are making, so in some cases you will need to make additional `theme` arguments in your ggplot chain if you want to make any additions or changes to the style, for example to add or remove gridlines etc.

Example of how it is used in a standard workflow:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder) # Used as example data
library(tidyverse)

# Set the defaults
set_fm_style()

gapminder_2007 <- 
  gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007)

ggplot(gapminder_2007, aes(x = lifeExp, y = gdpPercap, colour = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x= "Life Expectancy", 
       colour = "Continent",
       y = "GDP per Capita\n($/person)",
       title = "GDP vs Life Expectancy")
```

### R Markdown Templates

- `fm_pdf`
- `fm_html`

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("https://flowminder.github.io/FlowmindeR/rmarkdownFormats.png")
```

### Basemaps 

The app offers convenient functions to access custom Mapbox basemaps for plots.

```{r, include = F}
library(ceramic)
library(tmap)

basemap1 <- 
cc_location(loc = cbind(-1.5, 50.99),  buffer = 2e5,
base_url = fm_mapbox_styles("basic"),
max_tiles = 9)

basemap2 <- 
cc_location(loc = cbind(-1.5, 50.99),  buffer = 2e5,
base_url = fm_mapbox_styles("no borders"),
max_tiles = 9)

basemap3 <- 
cc_location(loc = cbind(-1.5, 50.99),  buffer = 2e5,
base_url = fm_mapbox_styles("no names"),
max_tiles = 9)

```


```{r fig.width=9, fig.height=3, echo=F}

map1 <- 
tm_shape(basemap1) +
tm_rgb() +
tm_layout(frame = FALSE)

map2 <- 
tm_shape(basemap2) +
tm_rgb() +
tm_layout(frame = FALSE)

map3 <- 
tm_shape(basemap3) +
tm_rgb() +
tm_layout(frame = FALSE)

tmap_arrange(map1, map2, map3)
```
